// Write a program that assembles a car by giving requirements out of existing components. The client will place an order in the
// form of an object describing the car. You need to determine which parts to use to fulfill the clientâ€™s order. You have the following parts in storage:
// An engine has power (given in horsepower) and volume (given in cubic centimeters). Both of these values are numbers.
// When selecting an engine, pick the smallest possible that still meets the requirements.
// Small engine: { power: 90, volume: 1800 }
// Normal engine: { power: 120, volume: 2400 }
// Monster engine: { power: 200, volume: 3500 }
// A carriage has a type and color. Both of these values are strings. You have two types of carriages in storage and can paint them any color.
// Hatchback: { type: 'hatchback', color: <as required> }
// Coupe: { type: 'coupe', color: <as required> }
// The wheels will be represented by an array of 4 numbers, each number represents the diameter of the wheel in inches.
// The size can only be an odd number. Round down any requirements you receive to the nearest odd number.
